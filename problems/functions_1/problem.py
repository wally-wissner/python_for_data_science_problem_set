"""
The FizzBuzz problem is one of the most popular beginner level code interview questions. The FizzBuzz problem is as
follows:
fizzbuzz(n) equals "Fizz" if n is divisible by 3.
fizzbuzz(n) equals "Buzz" if n is divisible by 5.
fizzbuzz(n) equals "Fizz Buzz" if n is divisible by 3 and 5.
fizzbuzz(n) equals n otherwise.
Write a script that prints the first 100 FizzBuzz values.
