# Python for Data Science Problem Set

Python is a general purpose programming language with libraries for many different purposes. It can be hard to know what tools are available for data science and to know if you're using those tools effectively. This problem set will let you test your knowledge by seeing if you can solve problems like ones data scientists face. It gives gentle hints about what libraries and functions you might use and what your solution might look like. There are also sample solutions with varying levels of sophistication to compare your solutions to.
